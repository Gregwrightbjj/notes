## Class Notes

I try organize my lectures by topic area into atomic "modules," with the goal being to teach all of a module in a single day, and 1-3 modules per day. 

At the end of each lecture, I'll be posting class notes in this repo, including:

* My lesson plan for each module
* Code excerpts for anything we wrote in class
* A quick "distillation" of what we learned that day
* Curated references for further learning on the topics
