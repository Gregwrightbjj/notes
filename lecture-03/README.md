## Wednesday, January 28th

#### Today we:

* Ate bagels. *Round* bagels. Like the kings and queens we are
* Inhaled lots of dry erase marker fumes
* Talked about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournaments
* Learned about `kfm_alloc(group_info)` or [whatever](http://hackertyper.net/)

#### Today we actually:

* Learned the "arts and crafts method" for deconstructing a webpage into its component elements
    * Broke down a lot of parts of pages
* Reviewed `display:block`, `display:inline-block`, and `display:inline`
* Learned about the `position` CSS property
    * `static` -- normal
    * `fixed` -- stuck to inside of screen, scrolls with you
    * `relative` -- place element so that it affects other elements, then pick up and put in 3-D layer
    * `absolute` -- **do not** place element so that it affects other elements, but put into 3-D layer immediately
* Learned about positioning properties
    * `top` and `bottom`
    * `left` and `right`
    * How `relative` uses positioning properties as instructions (`top: 10px` = move 10px down)
    * How `absolute` uses positioning properties as coordinates (`top: 10px` = placed 10px from top of page) 

Code samples are attached to this repository in the `code` folder.
