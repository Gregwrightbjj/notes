## Thursday, February 5th

#### Today we learned about:

* Functional programming!
  * Apply an iterator function...
  * to each member of an array...
  * and produce a result
* Common functional programming patterns:
  * `map` - Produces a transformed array
  * `filter` - Produces a (smaller?) subset array
  * `reduce` - Produces a single value
* FP with underscore
  * Works in every browser
  * Works on **objects**
  * Bonus "patterns" -- `find`, `groupBy`, `sortBy`, etc
* Underscore utility functions
  * Just read the [documentation](http://underscorejs.com)
