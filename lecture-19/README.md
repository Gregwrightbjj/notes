## Thursday, February 26th

#### Today we learned:

* LESS, a compile-to-CSS stylesheet language
    * Variables with `@variableName: value`
    * Nested pseudo-classes and combinators
    * [Loops](http://lesscss.org/features/#loops-feature), if you're a sadist
    * Built in [features](http://lesscss.org/features/#features-overview-feature-operations) like `darken` and `lighten`
    * Requires server-side middleware - use example from classwork
* Responsive design
    * Apply different stylesheet rules based on device/screen size
    * `@media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 700px) { /* ... */ }`
    * **Not** a different site based on screen size; the same site with content displayed differently
* Grid systems
    * Columnar layout
    * `display:inline-block;` with specific widths
    * Offsets with `margin-left`
    * Created `grid.css`
* Actually made good use of generic callback functions for once
* Sigh... recursion
