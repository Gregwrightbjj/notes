* John's ability to do addition, correctly
* How much we all hate CSS

#### Today we actually discussed:

* [YavaScript!](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) A brief history:
    * Netscape (*ne√©* Mozilla) Navigator, 1995
    * ECMAScript
    * Douglas Crockford's "JS The Good Parts"
* JavaScript "primitive types"
    * Strings
    * Numbers
    * Booleans
    * `undefined`
* Operators
    * Math (featuring `%`, or "modulus")
    * `+` only for strings
    * Triple equals vs. double equals
    * "and" (`&&`)
    * "or" (`||`)
    * "not" (`!`)
* Control flow and code blocks
    * `if`, and occasional `else`
    * `for`
    * `while`
* Forking and cloning a repo on GitHub
* Test-Driven Development!

**The homework assignment is to make all tests in the js-data-types repository pass.** Since I'm posting the notes at 5pm and everyone submitted it and completed it... well done!
