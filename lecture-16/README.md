## Monday, February 23rd

#### Today we learned:

* Object-oriented JavaScript!
    * `var ClassName = function() { ... }`
    * `new ClassName`
    * `this`
    * `ClassName.prototype.methodName = function() { ... }`
* OO vocabulary, so you can sound smart
    * "Constructors"
    * "Properties"
    * "Methods"
    * "Instances", created by "Instantiation"
* Generating a 6-sided die roll: `Math.ceil(Math.random() * 6)`
* Solid OOP principles
    * Start with the most granular, build outward
    * Encapsulate property logic with methods
    * DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
