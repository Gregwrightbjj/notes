## Thursday, January 29th

#### Today we:

* All decided to skip the free Thursday pourovers, except for me, and let me tell you that you all made a terrible decision
* Wondering who's more likely to be a serial killer, Josh or James
* Looked at so many pictures of puppies

#### Today we actually:

* Discussed "semantic HTML" - if you can, use the HTML tag that most closely matches what the content that it's wrapping is. Why?
    * Accessability
    * Page crawling robots
* Worked with `<input>` elements
    * `type=text`
    * `type=password`
    * `type=radio` (connects to others via `name`)
    * `type=checkbox`
    * `type=file`
    * `type=date`
    * `type=time`
* Worked with other interactive elements
    * `label`
    * `button`
    * `select` and `option`
* Learned to use CSS reset files (specifically [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/))
* Discussed how `position:absolute` *actually* works, as relative to other *positioned* elements
* Discussed CSS combinators
    * It's better to use classes on elements
    * `x y` finds all Y inside of an X, no matter how deep
    * `x > y` finds any Y that's an immediate child of X, just the one level deep
* Talked about some nifty developer tools
